# Why Model


Redux Model is created to enhance original redux framework, which has complex development flow and lots of template fragments, and then cause low efficiency.

With typescript, you are required to define type or inject interface for every action and reducer. Additionally, it's difficult to build relation between request action and middleware through type definition.

Fortunately, **Redux Model** has resolved the whole problems. Simplify development flow, reduce code size, smart type checking, and so on.
